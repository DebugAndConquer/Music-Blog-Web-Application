# Music-Blog-Web-Application
A simple blog-type web application is implemented to practice my Laravel skills.

Virtual machine to imitate the server or the actual server is needed to launch the application.
Please follow this link to install the virtual machine: https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/homestead
When done, store all the files inside a Laravel projects directory and name the subdirectory cw1
Add http://cw1.test/ to your hosts file, so the browser would know how to interpret the URL.
